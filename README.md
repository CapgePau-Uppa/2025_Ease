# 2025_Ease

## Project Explanation

This project aims to create a website where you can search for non-European brands and receive alternative European brands. This can help promote European brands and encourage local consumption, which can have beneficial effects on the environment.

### Features

On our website, you can:

- Search for a brand/category or products and receive alternative European brands/products similar to those you've searched for,
- Suggest a product/brand you think is a good alternative,
- Rate the alternative to give other users product advice.

## Project Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (latest LTS version recommended)
- **Angular CLI** (for the frontend)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **CouchBase** (if you want to run the project in development mode)

### Installation Steps

#### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <https://github.com/CapgePau-Uppa/2025_Ease.git>
cd <2025_Ease>
```

#### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root of your directory and install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm run install:all
```

#### Import the Environment File

Place the `.env.production` file at the project root (place your .env file where the `.env.sample` file is). If necessary, you may need to modify this part of the `\2025_Ease\backend\src\main.ts` file to adapt it to your .env file:

```sh
// Load the right .env
const envFile = path.resolve(
  __dirname,
  "../../.env." + (process.env.NODE_ENV || "development")
);
dotenv.config({ path: envFile });
console.log(`ðŸš€ Running in ${process.env.NODE_ENV} mode`);
```

#### Couchbase
1. for the production mode :

    As far as production mode is concerned, you don't need to install anything as you'll be accessing the deployed database, just make sure that in your `.env.production` all your variables are correct.

2. for development mode :

    For development mode, you need to install couchbase, create your server, bucket and index.

    - To install couchbase locally, go to this url: `https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=couchbase-server` and install the couchbase serve community (the free one).
    - Once installed, log in, follow the steps and create a server (the server itself isn't very important, but make sure you remember your access codes).
    - Create a user (make sure it's an admin user, and note the login ID - it's very important).
    - Create all the buckets you need, making sure that the names of the buckets you've just created match those of your `.env.development`.
    - Create your index on your bucket products

  #### Note:

  - Make sur all your variables in your `.env.development` match those in your couchbase database, including the bucket's name and index's name. 
  - For development mode, the `DB_HOST` of the `.env` must be the IP of the machine hosting couchbase (if you're local then you must put your IP).
  - /!\ If you can't connect to the database, check that you don't have a VPN. CouchBase prevents connection if you have one, so use a private connection such as your connection share or a personal Wifi.

## Starting the Project

You have several options for launching the project, depending on your needs and workflow.

### Option 1: Launch the Entire Project via the Global package.json

This method allows you to start both the frontend and the backend from a single terminal. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

```sh
npm run start:prod
```

### Option 2: Launch the Frontend and Backend in Separate Terminals

This approach is especially suitable for development mode and offers greater flexibility.

1. Starting the Frontend

    Open a terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and run:

    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```

2. Starting the Backend

    Open another terminal, navigate to the backend folder, and choose one of the following commands:

    To start in development mode:
    ```sh
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    To start in production mode:
      ```sh
      npm run start:prod
      ```

    #### Notes:
    You can launch the project components either via the global `package.json` or by using the specific scripts in the frontend and backend folders, depending on which method suits you best.
    In this case, you may need to take a look at each `package.json` to find out which script to run according to your needs (in the `package.json` files, look for the `scripts` section).

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed before starting the applications.
- Make sure that the `.env.production` file contains all required environment variables for the backend.
- If any issues arise, check the logs and ensure that the ports used by both frontend and backend are not occupied.
- Sometimes, you'll get an error message saying:

```sh
NOTE: Raw file sizes do not reflect development server per-request transformations.
An unhandled exception occurred: EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rmdir 'your_path\ProjetTutore_CapG\frontend\.angular\cache\19.1.5\frontend\vite\deps_ssr'
See "your_path\AppData\Local\Temp\ng-RHFVO8\angular-errors.log" for further details.
```

To solve this problem, you need to go to this folder `your_path\ProjetTutore_CapG\frontend\.angular\cache\19.1.5\frontend\vite\` and delete it. You can delete the entire `\vite\` folder, or just the `deps_ssr` and `deps` files, depending on the error message you have.

# Docker Deployment Guide

This section explains how to deploy the complete application (frontend, backend, and Couchbase) using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Docker Compose installed on your machine

## Project Structure for Docker

```
projetCapG/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                # NestJS Application
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/               # Angular Application
â”œâ”€â”€ bucketsJSON/            # Couchbase initialization scripts and data
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.docker            # Environment variables for Docker
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml     # Docker Compose configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx-proxy.conf       # Nginx reverse proxy configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ start-docker.cmd       # Launch script for Windows
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Configuration

All environment variables are defined in the `.env.docker` file at the project root. If you want to modify parameters (ports, bucket names, etc.), you can edit this file.

## Docker Architecture

The Docker deployment uses a multi-container architecture:

1. **Couchbase**: Database server
2. **Backend**: NestJS application running on port 3001
3. **Frontend**: Angular application served by Nginx on port 80 within the container
4. **Nginx Proxy**: Reverse proxy that routes requests between the frontend and backend

The communication flow is:
- Browser â†’ Nginx Proxy (port 8081) â†’ Frontend or Backend
- Frontend container communicates with Backend through relative URLs (e.g., `/api/...`)
- Nginx Proxy routes all `/api/` requests to the Backend service

## Starting the Project with Docker

To start the entire application, including the backend, frontend, and Couchbase:

### On Windows

Run the `start-docker.cmd` script at the project root:

```
.\start-docker.cmd
```

Note the `.\` prefix which is required in PowerShell to run scripts in the current directory.

Or you can start manually with Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:
1. Download the Couchbase image
2. Build Docker images for the backend and frontend
3. Start all services including the Nginx proxy
4. Provide instructions to initialize Couchbase

### Rebuilding Specific Services

If you make changes to the code, you can rebuild specific services:

```
docker-compose build frontend   # Rebuild only the frontend
docker-compose build backend    # Rebuild only the backend
```

Then restart the services:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Accessing Services

Once the containers are started, you can access the following services:

- **Frontend (direct)**: http://localhost:4201
- **Frontend (via proxy)**: http://localhost:8081 (recommended)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Couchbase Admin Interface**: http://localhost:8091
  - Default credentials: user1 / password (configured in the .env.docker file)

## Couchbase Configuration and Data Import

After starting the containers for the first time, you'll need to configure Couchbase and import data:

1. **Access the Couchbase Administration Interface**:
   - Open your browser at http://localhost:8091
   - The Couchbase initialization screen will appear

2. **Configure a New Cluster**:
   - Follow the setup wizard to create a new cluster
   - Configure the memory allocation based on your system resources:
     - For systems with less than 8GB RAM, reduce the default memory allocation for data services
     - For systems with 8GB+ RAM, you can use the default settings
     - Note: Systems with less than 8GB RAM may experience performance issues
   - Accept the default terms and services

3. **Create an Administrator User**:
   - In the Security tab, create a new user with administrator rights
   - Use the credentials defined in your `.env.docker` file:
     - Username: `user1`
     - Password: `password`
   - Make sure to select "Full Administrator" role for this user
   - This step is critical as the backend will use these credentials to connect to Couchbase

4. **Import Data**:
   - First, install the Python package for Couchbase:
   ```
   pip install couchbase
   ```
   - Then run the import script to create buckets and populate them with data:
   ```
   python bucketsJSON/importBuckets.py
   ```
   - This script will create all necessary buckets (BrandsBDD, CategoryBDD, ProductsBDD, UsersBDD) and import sample data

5. **Creating Indexes (if needed)**:
   - Once buckets are created and data is imported, you may need to create indexes to optimize searches
   - In the Couchbase Admin interface:
     - Go to the "Search" tab
     - Click on "Add Index"
     - Name your index (e.g., "IndexTest")
     - Select the "ProductsBDD" bucket as the data source
     - In the "Type Mapping" options:
       - Add fields to index one by one: category, FK_Brands, name, status, tags, description
       - For each field, select the "text" type
     - In the "Index Settings" options:
       - Check the options for French language
       - Enable the first 4 indexing options (default, standard, keyword, simple)
     - Click "Create Index" to finalize

## Stopping Containers

To stop all containers without removing them:

```
docker-compose stop
```

To stop and remove containers (Couchbase data will be preserved in the volume):

```
docker-compose down
```

To completely remove all containers and volumes (caution: this will delete all Couchbase data):

```
docker-compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Docker setup:

1. **Check container logs**:
   ```
   docker logs projetcapg-backend-1
   docker logs projetcapg-frontend-1
   docker logs couchbase
   docker logs projetcapg-nginx-proxy-1
   ```

2. **Verify Couchbase is properly configured**:
   - Make sure you've created the admin user with correct permissions
   - Check that all required buckets were created
   - Confirm the data import script ran successfully

3. **Frontend/Backend connection issues**:
   - The frontend container uses environment files optimized for Docker: `environment.docker.ts`
   - This ensures all API calls use relative paths (`/api/...`) instead of absolute URLs
   - The Nginx proxy (nginx-proxy.conf) routes these requests to the backend

4. **Rebuild specific services if code changes are not appearing**:
   ```
   # Rebuild and restart only the frontend
   .\rebuild-frontend.cmd
   
   # Rebuild and restart only the backend
   .\rebuild-backend.cmd
   
   # Rebuild and restart everything
   .\rebuild-all.cmd
   
   # Or manually:
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build frontend backend
   .\start-docker.cmd
   ```

5. **Reset everything and start fresh**:
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   .\start-docker.cmd
   ```
   Remember to reconfigure Couchbase and import data again after resetting.

## Important Notes About Couchbase Configuration

### Persistence of Couchbase Configuration

Couchbase configuration is persistent across Docker restarts due to the volume defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
volumes:
  couchbase_data:
    driver: local
```

This means:

- **You only need to configure Couchbase once**. The configuration will persist across container restarts and even after running `docker-compose down` (as long as you don't delete the volume).

- **If you run `docker-compose down -v`**, this will delete the volume and you will need to reconfigure Couchbase from scratch according to the manual configuration steps above.

- **If you modify bucket names or structure** in your application, you will need to manually update the Couchbase configuration to match these changes.

This is precisely why we've opted for a manual configuration approach - once configured, Couchbase will work correctly without additional intervention during normal restarts.

### When to Reconfigure Couchbase

You only need to reconfigure Couchbase in the following scenarios:

1. After executing `docker-compose down -v` (which removes all volumes)
2. If you delete the `couchbase_data` volume manually
3. If you change bucket names or structure in your application
4. If you're setting up the application on a new machine

In all other cases, including regular application restarts with `.\start-docker.cmd`, your Couchbase configuration will remain intact.
